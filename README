==Introduction==

This is a webapp a to helping user of renjian.com finding neighbourhoods.
Neighbour means the IDs are near your ID.
It's based on the API of renjian.com(http://renjian.com/api.html).
Now it supports both GAE and django

src : GAE version
renjian_neighbour: django version 

==Instruction==

deploying GAE is easy.
deploying django needs setting.py modified. There should be a database for the app, too.
